# Advanced Bandwidth Monitor

## üìå Overview
The **Advanced Bandwidth Monitor** is a web-based tool designed to analyze network performance by evaluating download/upload speeds, ping, jitter, IP address, device details, and real-time packet traffic. It provides an interactive and visually appealing interface with clear metrics and health indicators.

## üöÄ Features
- Fetches **real-time network performance** including:
  - Download & Upload speeds (Mbps)
  - Ping & Jitter values (ms)
  - Network health rating based on performance
- **Detects device details**, including OS, browser, and IP address
- Simulates **packet traffic** with randomized network activity
- **User-friendly UI** with dynamic results display

## ‚ö° Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS** (Frontend structure & design)
- **JavaScript** (Functional scripting & interactivity)
- `fetch()` API for retrieving the public IP address
- **Randomized network calculations** for simulation

## üîß How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Enter the number of packets to simulate (max 50).
3. Click **"Check Network"** to fetch results.
4. View **network health score**, speed metrics, packet details, and device information.

## üîç Future Enhancements
- **Real-time network monitoring** using WebSockets
- **Improved accuracy** with API-based speed tests
- **Export results** as logs or reports
- **Custom styling** options for personalize
